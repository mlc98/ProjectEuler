# ProjectEuler

Project Euler is a series of mathemathical challenges, aimed to improve our skills in this field. Each problem faces us to specific math topics, and our task is to resolve the problems assisted by computers. In this repository, I'll be posting my own solutions for the given problems, as well as optimized solutions I find on the web (only after giving my own working algorithm).
